# ToDoListApp
A small To-Do application that will allow users to keep on track of their lives. 
Hello Red Hat!

## Background
I will be developing this app in Java as it is what I feel most comfortable with. It is 
planned to be a JavaFX application.

## Storing Data
I shall be using XML to store the User data. The user data includes a name and password,
along with all of their Activates that need to be done.

## Activity
The Activity object will be the things that the user needs to do. It has a name, a short
description and the start and finish date.
