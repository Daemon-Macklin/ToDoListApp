# ToDoListApp
A small To-Do application that will allow users to keep on track of their lives. 
Hello Red Hat!

## Background
I will be developing this app in Java as it is what I feel most comfortable with. It is 
planned to be a JavaFX application.

## Storing Data
I shall be using XML to store the User data. The user data includes a name and password,
along with all of their Activates that need to be done.

## Activity
The Activity object will be the things that the user needs to do. It has a name, a short
description and the start and finish date.

## Authentication 
For my project I am using a simple method for user authentication. My method is not
secure as the passwords are saved in plain text in the xml file. But this functionality
of having multiple users is still there.

## JavaFX
I decided to use JavaFx as the GUI cause I am more comfortable with it.
